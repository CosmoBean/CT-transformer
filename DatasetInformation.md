## Dataset Information

The dataset comprises **18,000 postero-anterior (PA) chest X-ray (CXR) scans** in DICOM format, all of which were de-identified to protect patient privacy.

All images were annotated by a panel of experienced radiologists for the presence of **14 critical radiographic findings**, described below:
